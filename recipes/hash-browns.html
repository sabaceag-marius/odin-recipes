        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. 
            Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes. </p>
        <p>Good, old-fashioned, restaurant-style hash browns. 
            Perfect with hot pepper sauce and ketchup!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li><p>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. Place shreds in a 
                bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</p></li>

            <li><p>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, 
                place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole 
                bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</p></li>

            <li><p>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 
                minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be 
                cut into quarters for easier flipping.</p></li>

            <li><p>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</p></li>
        </ol>
